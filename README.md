# Canada Diabetes Statistics Project

## Overview
This program was developed using C, to read, analyze and make calculations on a [CSV file](statscan_diabetes.csv) containing diabetes statistics for various demographics in Canada. 

This project was completed in an Introduction to C Programming course. Fundamental concepts in C programming such as pointers, file-reading, and memory allocation were implemented in this program. 

## Data Analytics
